# Android Project 4th Semester
**Class:** _IT-AND1-A21_

**Student:** _Viggo Petersen_

**App name:** _VIA Events_

# Abstract
VIA Events is an app to arrange events at the new VIA University College. It should allow users to create and view events meant for VIA students, at or outside of the University. The events can be public so all students can see and attend the event, or private so only invited users can attend. A possible feature would be to have a visible map of all the rooms at campus, so Students can easily locate the event, and with that the ability to book rooms with VIA.
